# Proposed Approach 



## Brief Summary 

The proposed model utilizes a deep reinforcement learning architecture to implement a vision attention based binomial malware classification system.  The system is fundamentally composed of multiple processes, each process vitally contributing to the whole.  The core processes are broken down and novelties are described in detail below. 



## Convolutional Neural Network 

A convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is a class of deep neural networks commonly utilized in image analysis and classification.  A CNN is essentially composed of convolution layers and pooling layers. The convolution layers use filtering to extract features from a raw image. Pooling layers reduce the dimensions of the feature map, therein scaling down the number of parameters and minimizing computation. CNNâ€™s contain the ability  to   autonomously learn feature representation from raw data. This allows the model to learn abstract features from a provided set of training data and apply feature representation in classifying testing data.



## Reinforcement Learning 

Reinforcement learning is a subsection of machine learning focused on the mapping of optimal actions to specific environment states, in aim of augmenting reward.
