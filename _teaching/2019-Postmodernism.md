- Modern is in reference to enlightenment period  
- - Reason, Induction, Scientific Truth 
  - There is an objective reality  
  - - Science, when carefully utilized can tell us about this objective reality  

- Postmodernism asserts the knowledge is not from a non-subjective lens.  

- - That in fact we cannot escape our bubble of perception and experience and all knowledge is from it  
  - Come with cultural, experience baggage/bias 
  - Always from a certain viewpoint  

-  The postmodernists look down upon the modernists for looking at truth with a capital T. Absolute Truth. 

- They want to get rid of grand narratives of absolute truth  

- These grand narratives cause tribalism, insofar as they are the substance that coalitions will use to stick together 

- - e.g Nationalism 

- Society doesn’t need to be as unified as it has been in the past 

- - We don’t all need to do the same thing, believe the same thing, subscribe to the same truth
