- Enter the conservation with socrates being accused of leading the youth Athens astray. Corrupting the youth. Introducing new gods and misleading the public religiously.  
- They run into each other and socrates explains the legal charges being held against him.  
- Asks why euthyphro is here. To which he replies:  
- - He is brining charges against his own father 
  - - Murder; of helper; Helper killed a servant; Father throw helper into a ditch tied up where he died of starvation and dehydration  
    - Euthyphro says that what his father has done has gone against divine law; therefore even though helper isn’t related its still wrong  
- Socrates claims that euthyphro must truly know what is holy; and wants to be his student to learn 
- Euth states what is holy is what is agreeable to the gods  
- Soc the gods themselves don’t agree; e.g they are always fighting in greek mythology; gods cannot themselves agree what they want  
- Euth states holy is what is agreeable to all the gods  
- Soc; is the holy approved by the gods because it is holy; or is it holy because its approved 
- Euth; gods approve of it because its holy  
-  Soc says that there must be a distinction between what is holy and what is approved of the gods. Because if what was holy existed before it was approved by them then they are separate in nature.  
- - The other side of the dilemma is avoided because if that is the case then there exists the ability holy being in a changing/dynamic state  
- Euth agrees upon a definition: what is holy is just. 
- Soc: what species of the just is holiness 
- Euth: that which looks after the gods; allows them accomplish their purpose 
- Soc: what is the goal of the gods 
- Euth; holiness is that which allows us to see what is agreeable/gratifying to the gods 
- Soc; holiness is science of requests and donations to the gods; sacrifices and prayers; What is it that the gods get 
- Euth; Gratification is that which they get 
- Soc; Holiness is not science of requests and donations; instead that which pleases the gods; or that is agreeable 
- Soc finishes the discussion with saying that we have come full circle; the original answer was is that is holy is what is agreeable to the gods and ended with the same conclusion.
