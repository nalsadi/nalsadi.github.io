- Founding fathers of America used his philosophy to constrcut the constitution 
- - Two Treatise of government were was where he indicated his political philosophy  
  - Second one was the one that affect the founding fathers 
  - He was responding to Robert Filmer 
- Robert Filmer used christian theology to back his claim of a natural state of monarchy in the world ~ patriarchalism  
- - Where man was appointed by the lord himself to rule over all the constituents of the world 
  - Born unfree children under the dominion of the lord  
- Locke firmly opposed this view of patriarchalism propelled by Filmer  
- We are born helpless; we need the guidance of our parents, therefore we are not born free 
- - Locke opposed this by stating what we are born free but just are unable to exercise it at birth/childhood 
  - Give an example: 
  - - We are born unable to exercise our rational at birth, would they concede to say that we are therefore born irrational beings. 
    - For the correct stance is that we are born rational beings, however we are just unable to express it  
- Lockes says Filmer has misinterpreted the Bible 
- And that we should not use the Bible as a source of political guidance, instead we should use or rational, because then we don’t have to worry about misunderstandings.  
- Using reason we can deduce universal truths  
- Who’s own ur body  
- - Most people feel self owned; sense of autonomy that accompanies it 
  - That we can make decisions for our self; we are not slaves to someone else  
  - We have a life given to us; and we have the liberty to control that life  
- Locke believes that you are entitled to property; you are entitled to the fruits of your labor 
- - When we use our liberty to work hard; we deserve the results it yields  
- If we are forced to use the resources of the world, who owns those resources? 
- - More importantly, who controls them? 
- Some methods of managing the resources: 
- 1. Assign a group of people to oversee these resources; They are assign to distribute the resources of the world with equity 
  2. Free for All; take and use these resources at liberty  
  3. - Not consistent with human nature/reality; humans want more 
- Lockes solution is that you have a natural right to the fruits of your labor  
- - Allows people who want to work hard and live better achieve desired results  
- Government exists to protect your natural rights of life, liberty and property  
- It follows then that if the government isn’t doing its job, the citizens can overthrow it
