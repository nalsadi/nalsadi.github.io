# Memory Types
### Static RAM 

  * 6 Transistors per bit, of which make up two inverters & two other for off/on 
  * Optimized of speed primarly and density secondly
  * Volatile
 
### Dynamic RAM 

  * 1 Transistor and 1 Capacitor per bit
  * Optimized for density
  * Volatile
 
### Volatile Storage
  * Magnetic Disk 
  * Flash RAM

# Memory Hierachy 
### Registers
  * Accessed Directly via user level ISA
 
### Memory 
  * Accessed Indirectly via user level ISA
 
### Disk 
  * Not Accessed via user level USA 

# Memory Hierachy In Detail
#### Level: 
 **0** - Registers.

 **1** - Primary Cache.

 **2** - Secondary Level Cache ~ Made of SRAM. 

 **3** - Main Memory ~ Made of DRAM.
  * Typically 1GB to 16GB for computers. 
  * In the hundreds of GB's for servers.
 
 **4** - Disk (Swap & Files).

# Locality 
### Temporal Locality 
  * Recently referenced data/instructions likely to be referenced soon again. 
  * Examples are for instance data in inner loops or hot global data. 
  * Here the hierachy is reactive; Move things up when accessed.
 
### Spatial Locality 
  * Data/instructions nearby referenced data/instruction likely to be referenced soon. 
  * Examples are elements in an array, fields in a struct. 
  * Hierachy is proactive; Move things up speculatively.
 
# Basic Memory Array Structure 
### Number of Entries
  * 2^n; n is number of address bits 
  * Decoder changes n-bit address to 2^n bit signal

### Size of Entries 
  * Width of data accessed, 256 bits / 32 bytes in example
  
# Finding Data via Indexing
### Basic Cache ~ Array of Block Frames
  * 32 KB Cache ( 1024 Frames, 32B Blocks)
  
### Finding Frame
  * For a 32-bit address
  * 32B Blocks ~ 5 Lowest Bits Locate Byte in Block ~ Offset Bits
  * 1024 Frames ~ 10 bits Find Frame ~ Index Bits

# Tags 
  * Each Frame Can Hold Multiple Blocks
  * All blocks with the same index bit pattern
 
### Lookup Algorithm
 
  **1** Read Frame Indicated By Index Bits
 
  **2** if(tag matches && valid bit set)        
   then hit -> data is good     
   else miss -> data not good 

# Handling Cache Miss

### Tag overhead of 32KB cache with 1024 32B
 * 32B Frames ~ 5 Bit Offset 
 * 1024 Frames ~ 10 Bit Index 
 * 32-bit Address ~ 32-bit Address - 5 Bit Offset - 10 Bit Index = 17 Bit Tag
 * (17 Bit + 1 Bit Valid) * 1024 Frames = 18Kb Tags = 2.2KB ~~~ 2.2/32 = 0.68 ~ 6.8%

# Cache Performance
 * tavg = t_hit + (%miss * t_miss)
 * %miss will change depending on program because: 
   - %miss = #miss/#accesses
   - Each program will have a different number of accesses

# Cache Calculations

### 4 Bit Address ~ 8B Cache, 2B Blocks
 * Number of Frames = (Capacity/Block Size) = 8/2 = 4 Frames
 * Offset = log2(2) = 1 ~ 000*0*
 * Index = log2(#Frames) = log2(4) = 2 ~ 0*00*0
 * Tag = 4 - 1 - 2 = *0*000
