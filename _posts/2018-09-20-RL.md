## What Is Reinforcement Learning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinforcement Learning is a section of machine learning that is interested in designing autonomous agents, capable of sensing and acting within the given parameters (environment), while also learning and advancing its decision making process.

## The Process 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The process begins with a software agent placed within an environment. Through a series of back and forth communication, the agent learns about its current environment and how to optimize its decision making process in order to maximize the cumulative rewards. We can easily visualize this process with the following:
